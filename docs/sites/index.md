Login Rules
===

Have you forgotten the user ID or password to a website, tried recovering them and remembering them *just* as you're setting a new one because the rules helped you remember? If so, this site is for you.

Login Rules is a repository of the rules that websites have for their user IDs and passwords. 

Search for a site by appending `/sites/<site domain>` on the address bar of your browser. If the site's info's available, we'll show it. If not, do consider contributing so others can benefit.

Note: use the main domain name, not subdomains. So `/sites/google.com`, not `/sites/accounts.google.com`
